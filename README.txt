A dummy application that allows you to search for, and book an appointment with, GP practices in Scotland. If you have somehow wondered in here from the wider internet, please note the booking functionality does not actually work.

To run the app locally, run the below commands in the root directory:

npm install
cd front-end && npm install && npm run build
cd ../ && npm run start

This will build the react application and then start the node server.

You can view the finished application here (https://infinite-reef-31320.herokuapp.com/).
